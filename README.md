# r3dfs-tool
An explorer-like tool that allows *browsing* and *extracting* files in r3dFS-Containers used by the [Eclipse Engine (*useless-link*)](http://www.engine3d.com/). The engine was originally developed by [Void Production LLC](http://www.mobygames.com/company/void-production-llc) and aquired by [Arktos Entertainment Group](http://arktosentertainment.com) in 2008.

The engine has been licensed by several game studios including:
* Hammerpoint Interactive
* Online Warmongers LLC

Known games using the Eclipse Engine are:
* [War Inc. Battlezone](http://thewarinc.com/)
* [The War Z](http://playwarz.com/) (*now known as Infestation Survivor Stories*)
* [Infestation Survior Stories](http://infestationmmo.com/) (*discontinued, new name Romero's Aftermath*)
* [Romero's Aftermath](http://willyousurvive.com/)

Since three out of these four games are actually the same game, there are only 2 games in total using this engine.
